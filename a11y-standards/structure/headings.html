<p>Headings are used to give titles to sections and subsections of pages. Usually headings are visually styled to be large and bold text compared to the text below the heading.</p>
<h2>Impacted Users</h2>
<p>Screen reader users need meaningful heading text and proper heading structure to understand the organization of the page and navigate to the content they want to read.</p>
<p>Users with cognitive disabilities need good heading structure and useful heading text to improve the readability and usability of the page.</p>
<h2>Designers</h2>
<h3>Identify heading and subheading text as heading elements at the proper level.</h3>
<p>In your designs make sure to annotate the heading text as heading tags with the proper heading level. The goal is to tell the developers what text is heading text and what the correct heading level should be when coded.</p>
